THE ROOT PROBLEM
When users tap "Play Worship Music" on iOS:

✅ A modal (pop-up) appears showing the YouTube player
❌ BUT the YouTube video player doesn't actually render/show up
❌ The area where the video should be stays blank/dark

The button works and the modal opens, but the YouTube iframe (the video player container) is invisible or broken.

WHY THIS HAPPENS ON iOS (But Not Android/Desktop)
On iOS, Apple's Safari browser (and all iOS browsers use Safari under the hood) has very strict rules about how YouTube videos can play:
The Gesture Chain Rule:

iOS says: "A user tap can only trigger video playback if the tap happens directly ON the video player itself"
When you tap the "Play Worship Music" button, the tap doesn't touch the YouTube player directly
So iOS blocks the playback
Additionally, if the video player is hidden or resized after the tap, iOS gets confused

What Actually Breaks the Player:

Your YouTube iframe was created when the container was tiny (1px × 1px)
Later, you try to show it in a modal with proper dimensions (like 450px × 253px)
But YouTube's iframe doesn't automatically resize - it stays 1px × 1px
So even though the modal opens, the tiny invisible iframe never renders the video


WHY YOUR PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS FAILED
AttemptWhat You TriedWhy It FailedAttempt 1Call playVideo() from the buttoniOS blocks programmatic play; gesture must originate from the video elementAttempt 2Show a modal with the playerThe iframe was created at 1px, so changing CSS container size didn't resize itAttempt 3Embed YouTube iframe directly in modalYouTube's embed API blocked it with Error 153 (referrer issues)Attempt 4Use youtube-nocookie domainStill blocked by referrer policy restrictionsAttempt 5Keep player always mounted with fixed CSSContainer looked right, but the iframe inside never resized, stayed invisible
The core issue: You were trying to resize the container with CSS, but YouTube's actual iframe element wasn't listening to those CSS changes.

THE SOLUTION: Use YouTube's Built-In setSize() Method
Here's the fix in plain language:
Instead of:

Trying to hide/show the player
Hoping CSS changes would resize it
Creating new iframes

Do this:

Use YouTube's own API method called setSize()
This method directly tells the YouTube iframe: "Change your width to X pixels and height to Y pixels"
It's like sending a command directly to the YouTube player saying "resize yourself"


WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE FIX

User taps "Play Worship Music" button
Modal opens and showiOSModal() is called
Code calculates: "This device is 375px wide, so 90% = 337px wide. With 16:9 aspect ratio, height = 190px"
Code tells YouTube API: player.setSize(337, 190)
YouTube API directly updates the iframe's actual dimensions in the HTML
The iframe now renders correctly at the proper size
User can tap the play button and the video plays! ✅


WHY THIS WORKS ON iOS

✅ No CSS tricks: We're using the official YouTube API method designed for resizing
✅ Proper timing: We wait 100ms for the DOM to settle before calling setSize()
✅ Error handling: If something goes wrong, it logs a warning instead of crashing
✅ Direct control: We're directly commanding the YouTube player, not hoping CSS will work


SIMPLE ANALOGY
Think of it like a TV:

Old approach: You open the TV box (modal opens), but the actual TV screen inside is still folded up tiny. Changing the box size doesn't help.
New approach: You open the box AND you press the "expand screen" button on the TV itself. The TV screen expands to fill the space properly.


THE ACTUAL CODE CHANGE
Currently your showiOSModal() function probably does:
javascriptconst showiOSModal = () => {
  setiOSModalMode(true);
  // That's it - just show the modal
};
We need to change it to:
javascriptconst showiOSModal = () => {
  setiOSModalMode(true);
  
  // Also tell YouTube API to resize the iframe to proper dimensions
  if (playerRef.current && typeof playerRef.current.setSize === 'function') {
    const viewportWidth = window.innerWidth;
    const containerWidth = Math.min(viewportWidth * 0.9, 500); // 90% of screen, max 500px
    const containerHeight = containerWidth * (9 / 16); // Calculate height for 16:9 video
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      playerRef.current?.setSize(Math.floor(containerWidth), Math.floor(containerHeight));
    }, 100); // Wait 100ms for DOM to be ready
  }
};

SUMMARY

Problem: iOS player doesn't show because the iframe is 1px × 1px and CSS can't resize YouTube iframes
Root Cause: You were relying on CSS to resize, but YouTube's API needs explicit commands
Solution: Use player.setSize(width, height) to directly command the YouTube iframe to resize
Result: The iframe properly renders, user can tap play, video works! ✅
